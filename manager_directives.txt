**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Project Scaffolding (Priority 1)**
   - Create `README.md` with project overview, setup, and architecture.
   - Create `Makefile` with `test`, `build`, `clean` targets.
   - Set up `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories.

2. **Qdrant Vector DB Setup (Priority 1)**
   - Dockerize Qdrant or use cloud instance.
   - Write connection helper with error handling.

3. **MCP Server Framework (Priority 1)**
   - Use FastAPI/Express.js for REST API.
   - Ensure OpenAPI/Swagger docs are generated.

4. **Frontend (Priority 2)**
   - Basic React chat UI (no fancy animations yet).
   - Must be responsive and accessible.

5. **Intent Router (Priority 2)**
   - Use TypeScript for type safety.
   - Must log intents for debugging.

6. **Testing (Priority 3)**
   - Write unit tests for all core functions.
   - Set up CI (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI).

**CODE QUALITY RULES:**
- No code without JSDoc/TypeScript.
- No temp files left behind.
- No "just working" code—must be tested.

**REPORTING:**
- If stuck, write to `blockers.txt`.
- If unsure, ask in `questions.txt`.
