**URGENT: PROJECT RESET REQUIRED**
- **All features are failing (0/10).** This is unacceptable.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. **Reset the project** if the current state is unsalvageable.
  2. **Start with infrastructure** (Project Scaffolding, Qdrant, MCP Servers).
  3. **No new features** until core infrastructure is stable.
  4. **Document everything**—no undocumented code will be accepted.
  5. **Clean up temp files**—ensure `temp_files.txt` is empty.

**Quality Enforcement:**
- **No "just working" code.** All functions must be:
  - Typed (TypeScript preferred).
  - Documented (JSDoc/Markdown).
  - Tested (unit/integration tests).
- **No debris.** Remove all unused files.

**Next Priority:**
- [infrastructure] Project Scaffolding (Must pass before anything else).
- [data_layer] Qdrant Vector Database Setup.
- [mcp_servers] MCP Server Framework.

**Failure to comply = Rejection.**
